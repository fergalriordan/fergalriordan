# Hi, I'm Fergal 👋

### ML Engineer | 1.1 MEng in Electronic & Computer Engineering

I am an ML Engineer focused on the intersection of **efficient architecture** and **real-world impact.** With a background in Electronic & Computer Engineering from Trinity College Dublin, I bridge the gap between high-level deep learning research and high-performance production deployment.

- 🚀 **Currently Building:** [Mamba-RS-Engine](https://github.com/fergalriordan/Mamba-RS-Engine) – A C++/TensorRT inference engine for Remote Sensing change detection using State Space Models.
- 🛠️ **Working at:** [Channelscaler](https://channelscaler.com/) – Deploying agentic AI and RAG systems.
- 🌍 **Mission:** Leveraging ML for high-stakes domains like environmental monitoring, space tech, med tech, and humanitarian aid.
